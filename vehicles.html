	     		<p>This is a gallery of our latest custom creation. 
	     		When we started this project, it was a far cry from a motorcycle. 
	     		Rather it was an empty canvas that offered us limited possibilities. 
	     		After we received the frame and two crates of parts, we put our nose to the grindstone and went to work! 
	     		Many of the parts were lacking and several pieces were fabricated from raw material. 
	     		This is a joyous occasion, both for the proud owner and the proud creator. 
	     		White over black provides a striking contrast that screams: Here comes the 5-0! 
	     		Haha just kidding, but it does stand out from all the others. 
	     		For this work of art cannot be repeated and/or duplicated! 
	     		We have thrown the door wide open to abundant possibilities!</p>

				We are all familiar with this proverb, I myself have heard it referenced many a time in my life. 
				It is easy to just let a similar phrase to just roll off the tongue without giving it a second thought. 
				This proverb has spread far and wide due to the truth that it brings. 
				2013 is just around the corner, Let’s all make a pact to cease each day… You with me? 
				[That is if we all survive DOOMS DAY 2012!!!]

				I have not had the privilege to meet any of these preppers, however I do admire the diligence they practice.
				With that being said, it is time to prepare for the long cold winter! 
				If any members of the audience have recreational watercraft
				it is time to winterize them to preserve their quality.

				Now it is time to prepare for the cold weather and furthermore for next summer! 
				It is crucial to preserve your watercraft during the winter. 
				Winterizing your boat is easy and only takes an hour. 
				This hour of prevention will prevent a nuisance of repairs in the spring and summer.

				Winterizing is available for boats, jetskis and even personal watercraft. 
				@ MAXX MACHINES we are available to come to your home or storage or even to the
				lake in order to service your nautical necessities. 
				Although it is the time to give, let’s not donate your vehicle to be a home for pests and varmints!</p>
