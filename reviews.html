				  	Just wanted to say what a great experience I had at Maxx Machines in Lewisville! 
			      	I've taken my 2000 Dodge truck with ENGINE LIGHT ON to 6 or more shops, they all tried and failed, talked to mechanics, friends, google, etc. for over year, with no luck. I was ready to give up and get rid of truck, when someone told me to try Greg Foster, the Owner of Maxx Machines. 
			      	Sure enough he looked at it, said he could (like many other had said) but... HE DID IT! NO MORE ENGINE LIGHT!!! 
			      	He is very professional and honest! Trust me when I say he is the REAL DEAL!! Go see him!

					I have been using Maxx Machines to take care of my vehicle for 3 years now. 
			      	He is an awesome mechanic. As a single woman there aren't to many mechanics out there that will be honest with you. 
			      	Greg shoots straight with me. He has never tried to pad the ticket with unnecessary expenses. 
			      	If my car needs extra things he gives me what needs to be taken care of right away and what can wait in priority order. 
			      	I have sent him all my single female friends to him and they have been very satisfied as well.
